st.subheader("Piecemeal")
st.markdown("""
        This method is best suited for starting a new project or when you are reviewing linkages for a 
        relatively simple situation. Essentially load each of the necessary elements as found in the 
        main part of the Data Input page. For each of the data files (i.e. the left and the right) the user
        must indicate which columns uniquely identify a record in that data file. These variable are
        also those that are used in the Review File for indicating which record is being referred to.

st.subheader("Review Packet")
st.markdown("""
        This method is great for existing linkage review projects since it allows the user to load everything 
        simultaneously and immediately get to reviewing record pairs. This is done by defining a 'review packet'
        file, which is simply a json file with key value pairs indicating the value or location of all the
        necessary review elements. Once this file has been written and saved somewhere, simply upload it using
        the sidebar to the left on the Data Input page. If the file was specifified correctly, then all elements
        should be loaded instantly and the app will be ready for reviewing and labeling.

        This json file must have the following required keys:
         - **file_L**: Path to either a .csv or .dta file that contains the left side record data.
         - **file_L_ids**: List of column names (from the left file) that uniquely identify a row.
         - **file_R**: Path to either a .csv or .dta file that contains the right side record data.
         - **file_R_ids**: List of column names (from the right file) that uniquely identify a row.
         - **file_comps**: Path to either a .csv or .dta file containing pairs of record indices for review. 
         - **var_group_schema**: List of dictionaries where each element defines a variable group and has "name"
                "lvars" and "rvars" as keys which identify the group label, left columns, and right columns in the 
                group respectively.
                
        It may also have the following optional keys:
         - **label_choices**: List of label options. If not specified it will default to ["Match", "Not a Match"].
